## How to Use

See the introductory [blog post] on getting started building out this
project.

You'll need a GraphCMS account and the Blog Starter created, get the
endpoint from the "API Access" section in the project settings, check
the "Content from stage Published" checkbox for access.

Rename the `sample.env` file to `.env` and add your endpoint:

```text

```

Add the `VITE_GRAPHCMS_URL` variable and endpoint to the "Environment
Variables" section of the Vercel project.
